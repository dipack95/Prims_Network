# Prims Minimum Spanning Tree for a Graph
This is a Graph Theory based project to connect all the villages in an area, most efficiently. It uses the Prim's algorithm to construct the Minimum Spanning Tree for the graph. 

# Usage
Create a new Graph object. By using the `addNode(..)`, and the `addEdge(..)` functions, construct a graph.
The graph object contains variables that store all the edges, the nodes, and the number of nodes in the particular graph.

By default, the `addEdge(..)` function adds a bidirectional edge between the two target nodes. 
Another function, `addSingularEdge(..)` adds a directed edge between the two targeted nodes.

The Graph class also has functions to create, and populate an adjacency matrix, calculate the number of components in the graph, update and modify edges, and to check if an edge exists.
